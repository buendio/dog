            "question": "Are essential oils safe for dogs?",
            "answer": "Essential oils can be added to natural pet shampoos or conditioners to provide added benefits for a dog's skin and coat. One of the safest ways to use essential oils in bathing products is to order Tauro Pro Line Pure Nature shampoos and conditioners which already have carefully selected blends of essential oils in their composition. Another way is to use Tauro Pro Line Elixirs, which are blends of organic and essential oils. Elixirs can be diluted with Pure Mist alkaline water and applied as a mask before bathing, or added to selected shampoo or conditioner. It is important to note that essential oils should always be used in appropriate amounts and properly diluted for use on dogs. Additionally, it is best to consult with a veterinarian or certified aromatherapist before using essential oils on your furry friend, especially if they have any underlying health conditions or sensitivities."
